// art-672-fx-funding-sequencer: FX Funding Sequencer for T+1 (FX-SEQUENCER-BUILD-SPEC.md).
//
// WHAT IT DOES (spec "Functions / stages"): orders a trade's declared currency legs by FX
// cutoff, computes margin-to-cutoff minutes from the declared confirm time, returns an
// all-cutoffs-met verdict, and points at the PvP validator surface. Times are declared UTC
// "HH:MM" strings; the arithmetic is pure comparison math (cutoff minutes minus confirm
// minutes on the stated settle date). No calendar, timezone, or holiday logic is applied --
// every leg is assumed to settle on the one declared settle_date, as declared.
//
// PARITY TARGET: the canonical preimage embedded in FX-SEQUENCER-BUILD-SPEC.md. For the
// canonical policy_parameters, compute() must return an output_payload EXACTLY equal to the
// spec's output_payload; sequence, margins_minutes, all_cutoffs_met, trace, overall: those
// five keys, those values, NO extra keys; and executionHash(pp, output_payload) must equal
// the spec's staged execution_hash 1d4984b1e1c6efca36095590507adb92102ce7e1570d0ecc37517893737204fb.
// The trace string format is therefore load-bearing:
//   "<ccy> <cutoff> - <confirm> = <m> min; ...; order by tightest first"
// with legs listed tightest-margin-first, joined by "; ".
// Because the happy-path output_payload is parity-frozen at exactly five keys, the
// rationale / not_proven / fence / notice riders travel at the ARTIFACT level
// (buildArtifact), not inside output_payload.
//
// POSITIONING (spec Constraints): this tool computes arithmetic of DECLARED inputs under
// named rules. It does NOT check live SSR tapes, borrow lists, cutoff feeds, or registers,
// and never determines whether a declared cutoff is correct. The PvP check is OUT OF SCOPE:
// copy points at the PvP validator surface (the chaingraph settlement/PvP validator nodes,
// e.g. art-58-cross-network-settlement-validator) as a LINK, never a duplicated verdict --
// linked tools are pointers, never patch targets (row fence).
//
// NEVER GUESS, NEVER DEFAULT: an absent or malformed settle_date, confirm time, or leg
// (bad currency code, bad cutoff time, empty/absent legs) resolves to overall INDETERMINATE
// with each offending input named in rejected_inputs; never guessed toward a sequence.
//
// FINITE GATE: malformed input never throws; compute() always returns a defined
// output_payload. Zero network, zero storage, zero wall-clock reads inside compute().
//
