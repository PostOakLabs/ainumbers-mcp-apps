// Military Lending Act MAPR, recomputed by the Regulation Z actuarial method.
//
// 32 CFR 232.4(c)(2)(i) (eCFR versioner, retrieved 2026-08-14): "For closed-end
// credit, the MAPR shall be calculated following the rules for calculating and
// disclosing the 'Annual Percentage Rate (APR)' for credit transactions under
// Regulation Z based on the charges set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this
// section."
//
// So a MAPR is an APR over a WIDER charge set, not a different formula. This
// kernel therefore does two separable things:
//   1. Classify each caller-declared charge against 232.4(c)(1) and (d), and
//      fold the includable prepaid ones into the amount advanced.
//   2. Solve the Regulation Z actuarial rate on the resulting cash flows.
//
// The actuarial rules used in step 2 come from Appendix J to Part 1026, read
// directly (same eCFR retrieval):
//   (a)(2)  the actuarial method accrues finance charge on the unpaid balance
//           each unit-period or fractional unit-period.
//   (b)(1)  "The annual percentage rate shall be the nominal annual percentage
//           rate determined by multiplying the unit-period rate by the number
//           of unit-periods in a year." So annualization is a MULTIPLY by w,
//           never a compounding of the periodic rate.
//   (b)(6)  "The percentage rate of finance charge for a fraction (less than 1)
//           of a unit-period shall be equal to such fraction multiplied by the
//           percentage rate of finance charge per unit-period." A fraction is
//           therefore priced at SIMPLE interest, (1 + f*i), and only the whole
//           count of unit-periods compounds, (1+i)^t. Nothing in this kernel
//           ever raises a base to a fractional power.
// (b)(7) through (b)(9) are published in the eCFR XML as GIF graphics with no
// machine-readable text, so the discounting form above is derived from the
// (a)(2)/(b)(1)/(b)(6) text just quoted rather than transcribed from an image.
// The accuracy target is reasoned from 12 CFR 1026.22(a)(2)-(a)(3), which
// tolerate 1/8 and 1/4 of one percentage point; this kernel targets a bracket
// five orders of magnitude tighter than the stricter of those.
//

// host globals. Every exponent is an integer raised by squaring.

// participation fee "so long as the participation fee does not exceed $100 per
// annum". It is not a general exclusion from a closed-end MAPR, and the same
// paragraph adds that even that limit "does not apply to a bona fide

A rate is reported only when a sign-change bracket was established and narrowed, otherwise mapr_pct is null and MAPR_NOT_BRACKETED or MAPR_DID_NOT_CONVERGE is raised. The $100 participation-fee figure is the 232.4(c)(2)(ii)(B) open-end no-balance limit, reported as a cited constant and not netted out of this closed-end calculation. Whether a fee is bona fide and reasonable under 232.4(d)(3), and whether the 232.4(c)(1)(iii)(B) application-fee exception applies, both turn on facts this node does not hold and are surfaced as manual review rather than decided.',
